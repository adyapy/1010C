# 1010C

## What is 1010C
- It is a clone of the popular game [1010](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1010-block-puzzle-game/id911793120) by [Gram Games](http://gram.gs/).
- It is open source and can be used by anyone in any way.
- It is made with the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/) using the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture using the [Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp) framework.
- It is identical to the original game gameplay-wise but there are small differences in animations, visuals, audio, etc.

## Notes
- I am addicted to the original game.
- I had a score of over 130,000 and was in the top 200 in the world at some point, but lost the progress.
- I love the game and always wanted to implement it myself, so I finally did it.

## Contribution
